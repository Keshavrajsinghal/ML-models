# ML-models

This repository contains the implementation and experiments of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence prediction tasks.

## Overview
RNNs are a type of artificial neural network designed for recognizing patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, or time series data. This project delves into various RNN architectures and their applications.

## Features
Implementation of vanilla RNNs from scratch.
Exploration of more advanced RNN architectures like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units).
Datasets and preprocessing scripts for various sequence prediction tasks.
Evaluation scripts to gauge the performance of the models.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
